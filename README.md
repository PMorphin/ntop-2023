## Title
#### *Using ntop API and machine learning in order to detect suspicious activities in the network*
### Abstract
#### *We are revisiting the talk from 5 years ago, taking into account both the innovations introduced by ntop and the emerging technologies. The introduction of ntop Python APIs simplifies the use of collected data, allowing for easy exportation and utilization in one of the most well-known and widely used programming languages. Once exported, the information can be used as input in scripts, and with the support of Machine Learning, we can attempt to recognize malicious traffic or irregular activities in the network, such as data exfiltration.*
